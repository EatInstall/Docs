<div align="center"><i>About Eat</i></div>
<p>Eat is an open-source rootless package manager for Linux. No more root,
  just tell it what you want to install, and then you'll get the app properly.
  Eat works well for Debian and Ubuntu, but runs on almost any distro.</p>

<p>Eat works more simpler than APT. You don't need to keep using <code>sudo apt install foo bar</code>,
  just run <code>eatinst foo && eatinst bar</code>.</p>
